# Thompson Shell Redirection and Pipes (Conceptual)
# These features were pioneered here but were simpler.

# Output redirection
# command > outputfile

# Input redirection
# command < inputfile

# Pipe
# command1 | command2

echo "Redirection and pipes were foundational."
echo "Example: ls > files.txt or who | wc -l"
