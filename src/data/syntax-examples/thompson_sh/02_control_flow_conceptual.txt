# Thompson Shell Control Flow (Highly Conceptual)
# Original shell had very basic control flow, often using goto.
# This is a modern interpretation of what might have been.

# if (condition) command
# goto label

# : label
# command

echo "Thompson shell control flow was rudimentary."
echo "Modern shells offer much more sophisticated structures."
